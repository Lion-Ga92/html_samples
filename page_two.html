                    A great stench of filth and degradation haunts the lands of the New World. A decaying body, of a once noble person. 
                    She who promised wealth and prosperity to all her courters, Capitalism is dead. And she was killed by her wicked offspring, the Cruel Corporation. She promised wealth, freedom, and happiness.
                    But instead, the greed of man sought to enslave the children of 
                    the nations who courted her. <br>And soon after, Capitalism with all its gayety gave way to misery and filth. As greed and spiteful men conquered all beneath their feet in the pursuit of Mass wealth. As the markets were culled of Competition, 
                    and the restraint of Regulation.
                    More and more the Power of a few, dominated nations. There is a not entirely ironic reality in America. Despite the preponderance of brands for products, there are in fact no more than 6 overarching corporations that supply every demand of an American public lusting for 
                    the next great cheap thing. There is an illusion of choice, while the markets are being consolidated. Out of one, many. And these have slowly rotten away those flamboyant promises made to us by capitalism  when we broke the shackles of serfdom in the old world.
                    And started trading our work as a commodity.<br> America is a dying country, burdened by the stifled markets. Diminished value of our labor, and worsening labor conditions. We have become death. In the face of this depravity. In the face of a once great nation ruled by fattened 
                    politicians interested in increasing the power and wealth of an entire nation in the hands of a select few. <br> In the face of this disaster, of a nation clamoring for social justice and reform. Where the black man clamors to be spared from the bullets of the Police. 
                    Where the laborer clamors for a job to feed his family, and a roof over their head. In the face of an army of starved, and abandoned individuals. Who had their soul stolen from them by a system that just threw them under the bus and left them to fend for themselves. 
                    In the name of every man, woman. And child of this country. From citizen, to those that are not. I say enough!  I hereby propose:
